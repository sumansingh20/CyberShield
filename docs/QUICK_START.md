# 🎯 CyberShield - Complete Setup & Access Guide

## 🚀 **Your Project is Now Production-Ready!**

You now have a **fully functional CyberShield platform** - a professional cybersecurity testing application with real authentication, database integration, and working security tools.

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Deployment to Netlify**

### **Step 1: Setup MongoDB Atlas (Free Database)**

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
   - Click "Try Free" and create account
   - Choose "Shared" (Free tier)

2. **Create Database Cluster**
   - Click "Build a Database"
   - Choose "M0 Sandbox" (Free)
   - Select a region close to you
   - Name your cluster: `cybershield-db`

3. **Create Database User**
   - Go to "Database Access" → "Add New Database User"
   - Username: `cybershield-admin`
   - Password: Generate a secure password (save this!)
   - Database User Privileges: "Read and write to any database"

4. **Allow Network Access**
   - Go to "Network Access" → "Add IP Address"
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Confirm

5. **Get Connection String**
   - Go to "Database" → "Connect" → "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://cybershield-admin:<password>@cybershield-db.xxxxx.mongodb.net/cybershield-platform?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password

### **Step 2: Deploy to Netlify**

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # If not already on GitHub, initialize git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial CyberShield Platform"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repository
   - Build settings:
     - Build command: `pnpm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add these variables:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://cybershield-admin:YOUR_PASSWORD@cybershield-db.xxxxx.mongodb.net/cybershield-platform?retryWrites=true&w=majority

   JWT_SECRET=cybershield-jwt-super-secure-secret-key-2025-change-this-production

   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=cybershield-refresh-super-secure-secret-key-2025-change-this-production

   NODE_ENV=production

   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app

   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=CyberShield

   DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@cybershield-platform.com

   DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=CyberShield2025!
   ```

4. **Redeploy Site**
   - Go to "Deploys" → "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### **Step 3: Initialize Database**

After deployment, you need to create the admin user. You have two options:

**Option A: Auto-creation (Recommended)**
- The admin user will be automatically created on first login attempt
- Just try to login with: `admin@cybershield-platform.com` / `CyberShield2025!`

**Option B: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Run locally with production database
export MONGODB_URI="your-production-mongodb-uri"
pnpm run setup:admin
```
